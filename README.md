## 📘 Project Overview
The Music Recommender System aims to enhance music discovery by making accurate and personalized song suggestions based on user behavior. By applying machine learning techniques, the system learns from user patterns and provides music that aligns with individual listening preferences.

## ✨ Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides unique recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests songs based on similarities with other users' preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends songs by analyzing characteristics like genre, artist, or mood.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for developing the model.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Surprise**: A library for building and evaluating recommender systems.
- **Google colab**: For data exploration and model building.

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommender-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd music-recommender-system
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 📊 Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Load your dataset in the `data` folder. Ensure it includes relevant user and music information.
2. **Run the Model**: Open `MusicRecommender.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Use the trained model to provide song recommendations for a specific user.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for model implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies for the project.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
- **Integrate Real-Time User Feedback**: Improve recommendations by adjusting to user feedback dynamically.
- **Expand Dataset**: Use a larger, diverse music dataset to enhance model generalization.
- **UI Development**: Add a user-friendly interface for real-time music recommendations.
